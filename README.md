yaml2plot is a powerful yet lightweight Python package for creating interactive Plotly figures from YAML specifications and SPICE .raw files with minimal code. It supports dict, xarray Dataset, pandas DataFrame, and CSV-path plotting flows, declarative multi-axis plots via YAML configurations, and automatic renderer selection for Jupyter, VS Code, or headless environments. With case-insensitive signal lookup and robust multi-strip support, yaml2plot lets you focus on circuit analysis without plotting boilerplate.

## Features

- **Interactive Plotly Visualization**: Modern, web-based plots with zoom, pan, and hover
- **YAML Configuration**: Flexible, reusable plotting configurations
- **Simple API**: Plot waveforms with a single function call
- **Command Line Interface**: Quick plotting from terminal with `y2p plot`
- **Automatic Environment Detection**: Auto-detection and inline plotting for Jupyter Notebooks, render in browser when running in standalone Python scripts.



## Quick Start

### Installation
```bash
pip install yaml2plot
```

yaml2plot provides two common workflows for visualizing your SPICE simulations:

* **Option A: CLI-First** – The fastest way to get from a ``.raw`` file to an interactive plot. Perfect for quick, one-off visualizations.
* **Option B: Python API** – The most flexible approach. Ideal for scripting, custom data processing, and embedding plots in notebooks or reports.


### Option A: CLI-First Workflow

Get from a raw file to a plot in three steps using the ``y2p`` command-line tool.

**Step 1: Generate a Plot Specification**

Use ``y2p init`` to create a template ``spec.yaml`` file from your simulation output. It automatically populates the file with the independent variable (like "time") and a few available signals.

```bash
y2p init your_simulation.raw > spec.yaml
```

**Step 2: Discover Signals**

Find the exact names of the signals you want to plot with ``y2p signals``.

```bash
# List the first 10 signals
y2p signals your_simulation.raw

# List all signals
y2p signals your_simulation.raw --all

# Filter signals using a regular expression
y2p signals your_simulation.raw --grep "clk"
```

**Step 3: Plot**

Edit your ``spec.yaml`` to include the signals you discovered, then use ``y2p plot`` to generate an interactive HTML file or display the plot directly. The command now supports a self-contained workflow where the raw file is specified directly in the YAML.

```bash
# This command will open a browser window with your plot
y2p plot spec.yaml

# You can also override the raw file specified in the YAML
y2p plot spec.yaml your_simulation.raw

# To save the plot to a file instead
y2p plot spec.yaml --output my_plot.html
```

This approach is fast, requires no Python code, and keeps your plot configuration version-controlled alongside your simulation files.

### Option B: Python API Workflow

For more advanced use cases, the Python API provides full control over data loading, processing, and plotting. This is ideal for Jupyter notebooks, custom analysis scripts, and automated report generation.

The API follows a clear three-step workflow:

1. **Data Loading** – Load the raw ``.raw`` file with ``yaml2plot.load_spice_raw`` (xarray Dataset), load tabular data with ``yaml2plot.load_csv_data`` (DataFrame), or pass file paths directly to ``yaml2plot.plot``.
2. **Configuration** – Describe what you want to see using ``yaml2plot.PlotSpec``.
3. **Plotting** – Call ``yaml2plot.plot`` to get a Plotly figure.

**Minimal Example**

```python
import yaml2plot as y2p

# 1. Load data from a .raw file (returns xarray.Dataset)
data = y2p.load_spice_raw("your_simulation.raw")
print(f"Signals available: {list(data.data_vars)[:5]}...")

# 2. Configure the plot using a YAML string
spec = y2p.PlotSpec.from_yaml("""
title: "My Simulation Results"
x:
  signal: "time"
  label: "Time (s)"
y:
  - label: "Voltage (V)"
    signals:
      Output: "v(out)"
      Input:  "v(in)"
""")

# 3. Create and display the plot
fig = y2p.plot(data, spec)
fig.show()
```

**Advanced Example: Plotting Derived Signals**

Because the API gives you direct access to the loaded data, you can easily perform calculations and plot the results.

```python
import numpy as np
import yaml2plot as y2p

# Load the data and build a dict view for derived signals
dataset = y2p.load_spice_raw("your_simulation.raw")
data = {name: dataset[name].values for name in dataset.data_vars}
data["time"] = dataset.coords["time"].values

# Calculate a new, derived signal
data["diff_voltage"] = data["v(out_p)"] - data["v(out_n)"]

# Create a spec that plots both raw and derived signals
spec = y2p.PlotSpec.from_yaml("""
title: "Differential Output Voltage"
x:
  signal: "time"
  label: "Time (s)"
y:
  - label: "Voltage (V)"
    signals:
      VOUT_P: "v(out_p)"
      VOUT_N: "v(out_n)"
      VOUT_DIFF: "diff_voltage"
""")

# Create and display the plot
fig = y2p.plot(data, spec)
fig.show()
```

**DataFrame and CSV Inputs**

```python
import yaml2plot as y2p

# Option 1: load CSV into a DataFrame explicitly
df = y2p.load_csv_data("signals.csv")
fig = y2p.plot(df, spec)

# Option 2: let plot() route ".csv" path inputs automatically
fig = y2p.plot("signals.csv", spec)
```

For DataFrame inputs, ``x.signal`` can reference:
- a DataFrame column name
- the DataFrame index name
- ``"index"`` as a generic alias for the DataFrame index

**Migration Notes (Dict -> DataFrame/CSV)**

- If you currently build ``data`` dictionaries manually, you can keep the same ``PlotSpec`` and switch to:
  - ``df = y2p.load_csv_data("signals.csv")`` then ``y2p.plot(df, spec)``
  - ``y2p.plot("signals.csv", spec)`` for path-based loading
- When moving from dict keys to DataFrame inputs, make sure ``x.signal`` matches:
  - a CSV/DataFrame column, or
  - the DataFrame index name, or
  - ``index`` for the generic index alias
- Avoid ambiguous schemas where you have an unnamed DataFrame index and a real column named ``index``. Rename the column or name the index explicitly.
- CLI ``y2p plot`` now follows the same path routing as Python ``plot()``: ``.csv`` paths are treated as tabular data, while non-CSV paths are treated as SPICE raw files.
